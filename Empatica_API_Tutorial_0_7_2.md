# Empatica API Tutorial (0.7.2)
The steps described below assume you are adding the Empatica API to an existing project, or a new one you created from scratch.

You can also download an example Xcode project, already configured for use with the Empatica API, and start using your Empatica E4 in a matter of minutes. You are just required to use your Empatica API key in the AppDelegate.m source file and remember to delete the line starting with "#error"

- Download Single device example Xcode project
- Download Multiple devices example Xcode project

##Step 1: Setup

###Add EmpaLink API

1. Download the EmpaLink Framework for iOS from your Developer Area in Empatica Connect
2. Open your existing project.
3. Drag the EmpaLink Framework into your project's "Frameworks" folder.

**Note:** Make sure the "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" checkbox is checked.

###Add background communication support

EmpaLink can communicates with the Empatica device even while the app is in the background. Your app requires the authorization to run CoreBluetooth service in the background to work.

In order to enable background communications for app running in the background, we need to check the right "Background Modes" option in the iOS Target Properties.

1. In the Project Target, select "Capabilities" tab.
2. Enable "Background Modes" by clicking on the switch.
3. Check "Uses Bluetooth LE accessories.

##Step 2: Initialize the API

The final steps to set up the API require adding a few lines of code to your main app delegate. This is the class where you include iOS required methods like `applicationDidFinishLaunching`.

###Import the Empatica API header

At the top of your app delegate source file (and anywhere you invoke the DeviceManager class), youâ€™ll need to include the correct EmpaLink header.

If you downloaded the full version, simply add this line:

	// AppDelegate.h
	#import <EmpaLink-ios-0.7-full/>EmpaticaAPI-0.7.h>

Otherwise, add the following line:

	// AppDelegate.h
	#import <EmpaLink-ios-0.7-full/EmpaticaAPI-0.7.h>

###Set Your Empatica API Key

The EmpaLink API requires your developer key in order to make any requests to the API. Call this method with your API key when launching your app, adding the following code to your app delegate source file (usually AppDelegate.m):

	// AppDelegate.h
	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [EmpaticaAPI authenticateWithAPIKey:@"HERE_GOES_YOUR_API_KEY"
                      andCompletionHandler:^(BOOL success, NSString *description) {
        NSLog(@"Empatica API authentication successful: %d", success);
    }];

    return YES;
	}

In your app delegate source file, you also need to implement the following methods:

	// AppDelegate.h
	- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application {
    [EmpaticaAPI prepareForBackground];
	}

	- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
    [EmpaticaAPI prepareForResume];
	}

##Step 3: Use the EmpaLink API

Now you are ready to start using the EmpaLink API in your project. If your app will connect to one E4 device at time, read the Single Device section below. If your app needs to connect to multiple E4 devices at the same time, please jump to the Multiple Devices section.

###Single device

Your main view controller (for example, in the default single view app, ViewController.m) must implement the EmpaticaDelegate and EmpaticaDeviceDelegate protocols.

	// ViewController.m
	@interface ViewController () <EmpaticaDelegate, EmpaticaDeviceDelegate>

Ask the API to scan for devices, e.g., when you press a button

	// ViewController.m
	- (IBAction)ScanForDevicesButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    [EmpaticaAPI discoverDevicesWithDelegate:self];
	}

Connect to a device

	// ViewController.m
	- (void)didDiscoverDevices:(NSArray *)devices {
    if (devices.count > 0) {
        // Connecting to first available device
        EmpaticaDeviceManager *firstDevice = [devices objectAtIndex:0];
        [firstDevice connectWithDeviceDelegate:self];
    } else {
        NSLog(@"No device found in range");
    }
	}

Start receiving samples by implementing EmpaticaDeviceDelegate methods

	// ViewController.m
	- (void)didReceiveGSR:(float)gsr withTimestamp:(double)timestamp fromDevice:(EmpaticaDeviceManager *)device {
	// Do something with the received sample
	NSLog(@"GSR value received: %f at timestamp: %lf", gsr, timestamp);
	}

###Multiple devices

Your main view controller (for example, in the default single view app, ViewController.m) must implement EmpaticaDelegate protocol.

	// ViewController.m
	@interface ViewController () <EmpaticaDelegate>

Ask the API to scan for devices

	- (IBAction)ScanForDevicesButtonPressed:(id)sender {
    [EmpaticaAPI discoverDevicesWithDelegate:self];
	}

Create the E4 device manager

To allow your app to handle multiple devices, you will need to create a class (e.g., E4DeviceManager) implementing EmpaticaDeviceDelegate protocol. Each connected device will have, as a delegate, a different instance of E4DeviceManager class.

	// E4DeviceManager.m
	@interface E4DeviceManager : NSObject <EmpaticaDeviceDelegate>

Connect to all discovered devices

	// ViewController.m
	@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray *E4DeviceManagers;

	// ViewController.m
	- (void)didDiscoverDevices:(NSArray *)devices {
    if (devices.count > 0) {
        for (EmpaticaDeviceManager *device in devices) {
            NSLog(@"Device %@ Discovered", device.name);
            
            // Create a DeviceManager for each device
            E4DeviceManager *manager = [[E4DeviceManager alloc] init];
            [_E4DeviceManagers addObject:manager];

            // Connect to E4 device
            [device connectWithDeviceDelegate:manager];
        }
    } else {
        NSLog(@"No devices found in range");
    	}
	}
Start receiving samples by implementing EmpaticaDeviceDelegate methods in E4DeviceManager.

	// E4DeviceManager.m
	- (void)didReceiveGSR:(float)gsr withTimestamp:(double)timestamp fromDevice:(EmpaticaDeviceManager *)device {
    // Do something with the received GSR
    NSLog(@"[%@] GSR received: %f at timestamp %f", device.name, gsr, timestamp);
	}
