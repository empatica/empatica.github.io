###List of available devices

The client requires the list of Empatica E4 devices in range and available for connection. The server responds with the number of available devices and a list of devices info.

	Client Request
		device_list

	Server Response
		R device_list <NUMBER_OF_DEVICES> | <DEVICE_INFO_1> | <DEVICE_INFO_2>
	Example
		R device_list 2 | 9ff167 Empatica_E4 available | 740163 Empatica_E4 available

The format of the device info is the following:

	DEVICE_INFO format
		<DEVICE_ID> <DEVICE_NAME> <AVAILABILITY>
	Example
		9ff167 Empatica E4 available

**DEVICE_ID**
The device id is unique for every device. It is used by the client during a connect request.

**DEVICE_NAME**
The device name being used.

**AVAILABILITY**
Availability parameter is always available. Other values are reserved for future implementation.

### Connect to a Device

1. The client sends a connection request to a specific device.
2. Each TCP connection is allowed to connect to one Empatica Device at time.
3. To connect to multiple devices, multiple TCP connections are required.

	Client Request
		device_connect <DEVICE_ID>
	Example:
	device_connect 9ff167`

**DEVICE_ID**
The device id is returned from the server after a device_list command.

	Server Response
		R device_connect OK
		R device_connect ERR <reason>
	Example:
		R device_connect ERR The device requested for connection is not available.

### Disconnect from a Device

The client sends a device disconnection request. It will be disconnected from the currently connected device.

	Client Request
		device_disconnect

	Server Response
		R device_disconnect OK
		R device_disconnect ERR <reason>
	Example:
		R device_disconnect ERR No connected device.

In case of device disconnection (e.g., the user switch off the device, or the battery runs out) the server sends the following packet

	Device Disconnection
		X device_disconnect

###Subscribe to Receive Data

To start receiving data from a given stream, the client sends a data subscription request specifying the desired stream.

	Client Request
		device_subscribe <STREAM> ON
	Example:
		device_subscribe gsr ON

	Server Response
		R device_subscribe <STREAM> ON
		R device_subscribe <STREAM> ERR <REASON>
	Example:
		R device_subscribe gsr OK

**STREAM**

The streams available are the following:

- acc - 3-axis acceleration
- bvp - Blood Volume Pulse
- gsr - Galvanic Skin Response
- ibi - Interbeat Interval
- tmp - Skin Temperature
- bat - Device Battery

### Unsubscribe from Receive Data

To stop receiving data from a given stream, the client sends a data unsubscription request specifying the desired stream.

	Client Request
		device_subscribe <STREAM> OFF
	Example:
		device_subscribe gsr OFF`

	Server Response
		R device_subscribe <STREAM> OFF
		R device_subscribe <STREAM> ERR <REASON>
	Example:
		R device_subscribe gsr OFF`

**STREAM**

The streams available are the following:

- acc - 3-axis acceleration
- bvp - Blood Volume Pulse
- gsr - Galvanic Skin Response
- ibi - Interbeat Interval
- tmp - Skin Temperature
- bat - Device Battery
- tag - Tag taken from the device (by pressing the button)

### Suspend data streaming

To temporarily suspend the data streaming (without disconnecting or switching off the device), the client sends a pause request

	Client Request
		pause ON

	Server Response
		R pause ON
		R pause ERR <REASON>
	Example:
		R pause ERR You are not connected to any device`

### Resume data streaming

To resume the data streaming, the client sends a resume request

	Client Request
		pause OFF

	Server Response
		R pause OFF
		R pause ERR <REASON>
	Example:
		R pause ERR You are not connected to any device`

## <a name="data-streaming"></a>Data Streaming Packets
After a succesful connection and stream subscription to an Empatica Device, the client starts receiving sensor's data from the server.

	Stream Data Format
		<STREAM_TYPE> <TIMESTAMP> <DATA>
	Example
		G 123345627891.123 3.129

**STREAM_TYPE**

The streams available are the following:

## Using Empatica BLE Server for Windows (Beta)
NOTE: this part of the documentation is still under development

###Requirements

- Windows PC running Windows 7 or Windows 8 with Visual C++ Redistributable Package installed (download from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784))
- The app is currently working only with [Bluegiga Bluetooth Smart Dongle](https://www.bluegiga.com/en-US/products/bled112-bluetooth-smart-dongle/), Driver/Installation guide [here](https://www.bluegiga.com/en-US/products/bled112-bluetooth-smart-dongle/#login-modal
)
- Empatica E4 Sensor with firmware build 0.0.1.505+ installed (If you've bought your E4 after May 2015 the firmware should be already updated)
- Empatica E4’s must be registered to the API key owner to be accessible via the server application

###Installation

Download the latest release of the Empatica BLE Server for Windows (Beta) from [here](http://get.empatica.com/win/EmpaticaBLEServer.html)

###Configuration

The first time you start the server, you will see the settings panel that allows you to set:

- your Empatica API Key (you can find yours [here](https://www.empatica.com/connect/developer.php), if you don't have one check this [support article](https://www.empatica.com/docs/support.empatica.com/hc/en-us/articles/203296395))
- the listening IP address of the server (is the address where the Empatica BLE Server will listen towhere you have to connect to send commands and receive data, e.g. 127.0.0.1)
- the listening port of the server

After configuration set click the "Save" button.

###Using the server

You will see the default view of the server, click the "Start" button.

If the dongle is not connected (or your PC can't communicate with it, i.e. because you didn't install the dongle's drivers), the discovery won't start and the message "Dongle not connected" is displayed at the bottom.

If the dongle was not connected, plug it to your PC and press the "Refresh" button placed in the bottom left corner of the app.

If the dongle is connected, the server will start:

1. Discovery and connection to the E4 device within Bluetooth range and will start listening to commands on the address and port specified in the settings panel.
2. You can see the label under the button that tells that the app is discovering for E4.
3. You can now switch on your E4 and the led will start to blink green.

**When the connection is established the led will become light blue and then blue, meaning that the connection was completed.**

After a while (around 40 seconds), the led will be switched off in order to save battery.

When any device is connected, the device ID and the list of the current TCP connections are displayed.

When you want to stop streaming from a device, simply switch off your E4 and it will be disconnected from the app.

If you want to connect another E4 device, wait when the previous E4 is connected, then press the "Discover other E4 devices" button, the app will start to discover other devices.

Make sure to keep the devices not too close because the radios might saturate when the antennas are too close, resulting in lack of communication over-the-air

###Troubleshooting

**When I click "Save" in settings panel, I see the "Invalid Api key" message**

Please try to insert again your API Key (you can find your API key [here](https://www.empatica.com/connect/developer.php)). If you have still the issue, please contact our [support](support@empatica.com)

**When I click "Start", I can't get my E4 connected**

Try to follow these steps in order to get your E4 connected:

- Launch the app
- Check that the dongle is connected (you should see a "Dongle connected" label) at the bottom of the app's window
- Click the "Start" button
- Switch on your E4

If the app can't connect to your E4 before the led becomes red (and memory mode starts) please contact our [support](support@empatica.com) writing us your Api key and the serial number of the device you're using (placed close to sensor's led) -->
